# Tableau Titanic Dataset Visualization Workshop

## Overview

This workshop guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to explore and visualize the Titanic dataset using Tableau. From initial data exploration to creating insightful visualizations and dashboards, participants will learn essential Tableau skills to gain valuable insights from the data.

## Workshop Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Variable Selection:

- **Identify Useful Variables:** Analyze the Data Dictionary to determine important variables such as 'Survival', 'Passenger Class', and 'Age'.
- **Navigate to Tableau:** Open Tableau to begin the visualization process.

### 2. Initial Visualization Setup:

- **Create a New Sheet:** Start a new sheet in Tableau for data visualization.
- **Import Dataset:** Connect to the Titanic dataset in Tableau.
- **Understanding Data Types:** Differentiate between dimensions and measures in Tableau.
- **Dimension Selection:** Make all variables dimensions for initial analysis.

### 3. Visualizing Age and Survival Rate:

- **Binning Age:** Group ages into bins for visualization.
- **Creating Bins:** Use Tableau's binning feature to create age groups.
- **Visualizing Distribution:** Create a histogram or bar chart for age and survival.
- **Adding Percentage:** Calculate the percentage of total passengers for each age group.
- **Labeling:** Add labels to the visualization for clarity.

### 4. Exploring Other Variables:

- **Duplicate Sheet:** Duplicate the current sheet to explore other variables.
- **Swapping Variables:** Swap out variables like 'Age Bin' for 'Passenger Class' or other variables of interest.
- **Visualizing Different Variables:** Analyze the distribution and relationship of new variables with survival rate.
- **Custom Calculated Field:** Create custom calculated fields if needed.

### 5. Dashboard Creation:

- **Creating a Dashboard:** Build a dashboard to integrate multiple visualizations.
- **Adding Sheets to Dashboard:** Drag sheets onto the dashboard canvas and arrange them as desired.
- **Customizing:** Customize the dashboard layout, colors, and labels for better visualization.
- **Finalization:** Add titles, captions, and annotations as needed to finalize the dashboard design.

### 6. Final Review and Reflection:

- **Review:** Analyze insights gained from the created dashboard.
- **Reflect:** Discuss the significance of the insights and their contribution to understanding the dataset.
